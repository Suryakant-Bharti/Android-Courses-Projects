Intents, Activities, Content Providers, Services, Broadcast Receivers

## App Testing
Implement important "Testing Frameworks" like Espresso, JUnit, Mockito, etc. [Android-2/6] 

Code Samples for learning important Testing Frameworks for Test Automation in Android.

### JUnit 

### Android JUnit Runner
AndroidJUnitRunner class is a JUnit test runner that lets you run JUnit4 style test classes on Android devices, including those using the Espresso and UI Automator testing frameworks.

### Espresso
Use Espresso to write concise, beautiful, and reliable Android UI tests. Espresso is targeted at developers, who believe that automated testing is an integral part of the development lifecycle. Use Espresso to test Views, AdapterViews, Intents, Idling Resources, Web, RecyclerViews.

### UI Automator
UI Automator is a UI testing framework suitable for cross-app functional UI testing across system and installed apps.

### Mockito

### Robolectric
